##**Week 1**:
* On the first day of DISMATH, I learn about logics and proofs.
* I noticed that after all the sample logic problems i've encountered(i.e. mel and vin are either knights or knaves), i faced trickery.
* It seems that logic have ways to turn a person's mind on the other way round.
* I also learned that there are logical connectives, which are the ff: negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, exclusive or and biconditional.

##**Week 2**:
* I learned that statments can be proven by logical equivalences
* At first, i was very confused and soon, i was able to get them by effort
* Sometimes in proving, implication equivalences are made to make statements easier to solve

##**Week 3**:
* I learned about predicate logic
* it is logic that contains a predicate(I think)
* I somehow reminded me of the lessons I've learned in English since the words "subject" and "predicate" are mentioned
* Then I learned about quantifiers
* It is further classified into two: a)Universal b)Existential
* I'm surprised that the non-existence of my son(superman) can be proven(awwwww)

##**Week 4**:
* i learned about the rules of preference
* It's actually a set of theorems which states that a statement implying another statement is true
* I realized by fellow classmates that this lesson was used to prove the non-existence of superman

##**Week 5**:
* I learned about the methods of proving
* the firts two methods are Direct Proof and Contraposition
* The are easy to use, but hard to apply when given problem sets
* in one example, I learned about odd and even numbers
* odd number is 2k + 1, where k is any integer while even number is 2k where k is any integer
* I still remember from the second eeting of this week that 1.5 is an integer as i was trying to prove a challenge problem
* And like what i said, proving can have some cunning schemes

##**Week 6**:
* After i learned the firts two methods of proving, I learned about vacuous and Trivial Proof
* I also learned about the definition of rational numbers, which is a/b, where a and b are integersw and b must not be zero

##**Week 7**:
* I learned about the method of contradiction
* I find it difficult or tricky to understand since it differs widely from contraposition
* And it seems that the use of of contradictin involves irony to prove that a statement is true
