# dismathportfolio-Jor-El123
##**Week 1**:
* On the first day of DISMATH, I learn about logics and proofs.
* I noticed that after all the sample logic problems i've encountered(i.e. mel and vin are either knights or knaves), i faced trickery.
* It seems that logic have ways to turn a person's mind on the other way round.
* I also learned that there are logical connectives, which are the ff: negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, exclusive or and biconditional.

##**Week 2**:
* I learned that statments can be proven by logical equivalences
* At first, i was very confused and soon, i was able to get them by effort
* Sometimes in proving, implication equivalences are made to make statements easier to solve

##**Week 3**:
* I learned about predicate logic
* it is logic that contains a predicate(I think)
* I somehow reminded me of the lessons I've learned in English since the words "subject" and "predicate" are mentioned
* Then I learned about quantifiers
* It is further classified into two: a)Universal b)Existential
* I'm surprised that the non-existence of my son(superman) can be proven(awwwww)

##**Week 4**:
* i learned about the rules of preference
* It's actually a set of theorems which states that a statement implying another statement is true
* I realized by fellow classmates that this lesson was used to prove the non-existence of superman

##**Week 5**:
* I learned about the methods of proving
* the firts two methods are Direct Proof and Contraposition
* The are easy to use, but hard to apply when given problem sets
* in one example, I learned about odd and even numbers
* odd number is 2k + 1, where k is any integer while even number is 2k where k is any integer
* I still remember from the second eeting of this week that 1.5 is an integer as i was trying to prove a challenge problem
* And like what i said, proving can have some cunning schemes

##**Week 6**:
* After i learned the firts two methods of proving, I learned about vacuous and Trivial Proof
* I also learned about the definition of rational numbers, which is a/b, where a and b are integersw and b must not be zero

##**Week 7**:
* I learned about the method of contradiction
* I find it difficult or tricky to understand since it differs widely from contraposition
* And it seems that the use of of contradictin involves irony to prove that a statement is true

##**Week 8**:
* After learning proof by contradiction, I learned about proof by equivalence
* Its seems easy, but its actually long
* And i find it tedious to do since it requires extra effort of proving
* Then I learned about mathematical induction
* By the help of the review from ENGALG2, I was able to remember the concept of proving P(k) to be true, followed by P(k+1)

##**Week 9**:
* I learned a lesson of summation
* It is somewhat like a review from Algebra
* But it had some twist
* I would have to deal with recursion, which is making the value terminate(if i do remember the definition correctly)
* Soon, i began to face a little of algorithms

##**Week 9**:
* The next lessons i will learn this week is something more like software
* this time, the lessons are program correctness, program verification and hoar triple
* program correctness - proof is necessary to make the program work and it uses rules of inference
* program verification - makes sure that the progrm executes correct output for every possible input
* noar triple - a program is correct with respect to the initial and final assertion
* They are kind of hard to understand, but useful in programming

##**Week 10**:
* This week, i learned about Zeno's Paradox
* When this was discussed, i remember one of his students guess about the definition, saying that its like finding a love life :D
* You can approach her but it takes forever(hahahahahahaha #Valentines)
* Anyways, from that lesson, other review topics follow such as power series, geometric series and arithmetic series
* They are kind of easy to remember but when it comes to problems, they could be tricky to solve
* At least, i got the concepts quite well

##**Week 11**:
* This week, i learned about sets
* like the previous lessons, its like a back-to-back review from algebra
* sets are collections of unordered distinct objects
* They have so much applications such as finance
* I also learned that it has cardinality, which is defined as the number of objects in a set
* Then, I had a review about venn diagrams, which is a lesson taken from geometry class since high school
* Then, I was suprised that the universal and intersection symbol also have rules similar to rules of inference
* No wonder that the answers to venn diagram problems are so related

##**Week 12**:
* I leanred two things, nested quantifiers and functions
* In nested quantifiers, i have to deal with universal and existential qunatifiers again
* Also, I am assigned to use the to create a statement
* I find it hard since numbers cab be quite confusing to deal with
* In functions, there are three parts: domain, co-domain and range

##**Week 13**:
* For me, this week is the start of hardcore Dismath
* The reason for that is it is the start of studying algotrithms or pseudocodes
* For this week, I learned finding the maximum, linear search and binary search 
* When the pseudocodes are presented, i became puzzled
* My mind was like "Why i=i+1 wherein when solving for i, answer is invalid due to the fact that i-i=0, then 0=1, which is false" 
* After those discussions,  i realized that what sir said about dismath, which is the fact that I'll be facing "weird" symbols (hehehehehehehehe)

##**Week 14**:
* After the first three algorithms were discussed, another set of three algotrithms are presented
* This time, these three are bubble sort, insertion sort and greedy algorithm
* They are easy to understand when it comes to doing the steps and lists
* But when it comes to unsing its true nature, the algotrithm, they are hard to understand
* Then, iteration tables were introduced
* Honeslty speaking, i could hardly understand them since its hard for me to find a reason why number of inputs can be n-1 or something

##**Week 15**:
* The next lesson i encounter before the start of the econd quiz are the big-O, big-omega and big-theta
* big-o indicates upper bound, big-omega indicates lower bound and big-theta indicates both
* When i first hear the big-omega, it reminds me of Ohm's law or any topic about resistors
* anyways, to get those three, trial and error must be made
* I find it tricky since the correct answer mostly relies on luck
* Its more like betting which number really gets the function and which number doesn't
* It seems that the lesson is more like a guessing game, hehehehe

##**Week 16**:
* I learned about algorithm time-complexity
* Its more like knowing the number of comparisons made by the algorithm
* Like the previous experiences in the previous, i still get confused
* Little by little, i was able to understand a bit
* Surprisingly, one of the applications of algorithms in cryptology, the study of hidden messages
* By hearing that, i could like imagine myself revealing the secret message of an ancient rune or something
* Or maybe hide a message that i want to tell to someone like "hello"
