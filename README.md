##**Week 1**:
* On the first day of DISMATH, I learn about logics and proofs.
* I noticed that after all the sample logic problems i've encountered(i.e. mel and vin are either knights or knaves), i faced trickery.
* It seems that logic have ways to turn a person's mind on the other way round.
* I also learned that there are logical connectives, which are the ff: negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, exclusive or and biconditional.

##**Week 2**:
* I learned that statments can be proven by logical equivalences
* At first, i was very confused and soon, i was able to get them by effort
* Sometimes in proving, implication equivalences are made to make statements easier to solve
